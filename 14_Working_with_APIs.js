//Working with APIs

/**Working with APIs
 * When working with remote APIs, you need a way to interact with those
 * APIs. Modern JavaScript provides two naive ways to send HTTP requests
 * to remote servers, XMLHttpRequest and Fetch.
 * 
 */


/**XMLHttpRequest
 * XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is a built-in browser object that can be used to
 * interact with servers. XHR allows you to update data without having to
 * reload a web page. Despite the word XML in its name, XHR not only used
 * to retrieve data with XML format, we can use it with any type of data,
 * like JSON, file(s), and much more.
 * 
 */


/**Fetch
 * The fetch() method in JavaScript is used to request to the server and
 * load the information on the webpages. The request can be of any APIs
 * that return the data of the format JSON or XML. This method returns a
 * promise.
