# JavaScript Roadmap

These are notes about JavaScript from [this site](roadmap.sh/javascript) to help reinforce some core concepts.

The numerated chapters refer to the main topics outlined on the road map in order. Each chapter contains both notes from the roadmap, mdn, and my own personal notes.

The 'bonus' chapters starting with B refer to my personal chapter notes.



Reference Chapters:
B12 - All the familiar ways to interact with arrays.
B14 - Objets and the special way JavaScript uses them.
