// How to think about JavaScript between development and production.

/**Production
 * 
 * -> When deploying an app to production, you would want a single,
 *    bundled and minified.js file. This in theorth helps increase
 *    performance.
 */


/**Development Environment
 * 
 * -> During development, it makes sense to have multiple javascript
 *    files for an app, because it helps maintain clarity and
 *    organization.
 * 
 * -> When the app is finished, we just have to bundle the code to
 *    using a bundler to make it more performant and standard.
