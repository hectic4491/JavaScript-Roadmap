//Modules in JavaScript

/**Modules
 * Module encapsulate all sorts of code like functions and variables and
 * expose all this to other files. Generally, we use it to break our code
 * into seperate files to make it more maintainable. They were introduced
 * into JavaScript with ECMAScript 6.
 */


/**CommonJS
 * CommonJS modules are the original way to package JavaScript code for
 * Node.js. Node.js also supports ESModules standard used by browsers and
 * other JavaScript run-times, but CJS is still widely used in backend 
 * Node.js applications. Sometimes these modules will be written with a
 * .cjs extension.
 */


/**ESM
 * ESModules is a standard that was introduced with ES6. The idea was to
 * standardize how JS modules work and implement these features in
 * browsers. This standard is widely used with frontend frameworks such
 * as react and can also be used in the backend with Node.js. Sometimes 
 * these modules will be written with a .mjs extension.
